1) Create Fulls: Adobe Lightroom 90% quality, 2784px on long side.
2) Create thumbs via thumbs_creator.py, making sure to change the target folder.
3) Append the images to the json via json_creator.py, making sure to change the target folder (recommended to make a backup of the json!).

- The json_format_copier.py program allows you to update all the fields of a json file from a database json file (fields in this database will be copied over to the json in question if there is a match in filename). old_json_path is the json in question, new_json_dir is the database json.

- To create thumbs for main page, use Resize Image feature of the Windows Photos app, with 50% scaling and 80% quality.

Git Commands:
git add .
git commit -m "Name"
git push origin main

git pull origin main

- To create a private gallery:
1) Create fulls, thumbs, and json as normal, noting the new folder structure date/private/XYZ.json and images/private/XYZ/full/... XYZ represents the username.
2) Use encrypt.py to create .enc files of all the fulls and thumbs, making sure to change USERNAME to XYZ and PASSKEY to the password login for the website.
3) Delete the original fulls and thumbs from the images/private/XYZ folder.
4) Add "GalleryTitle": "NAME", to the first photo's JSON.
